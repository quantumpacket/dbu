# This is the ssh server system-wide configuration file.
# See sshd_config(5) for more information on any settings used. Comments will be added only to clarify why a configuration was chosen.
#
# Created for OpenSSH v5.9

# Basic configuration
# ===================

# Disable root login
PermitRootLogin no

# Define which port sshd should listen to. Default to `823`.
Port 823

# Address family should always be limited to the active network configuration.
AddressFamily inet

# Define which addresses sshd should listen to. Default to `0.0.0.0`, ie make sure you put your desired address in here, since otherwise sshd will listen to everyone.
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0

# List HostKeys here.
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

# Security configuration
# ======================

# Set the protocol version to 2 for security reasons. Disables legacy support.
Protocol 2

# Make sure sshd checks file modes and ownership before accepting logins. This prevents accidental misconfiguration.
StrictModes yes

# Logging, obsoletes QuietMode and FascistLogging
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel INFO

# Cryptography
# ------------

# **Ciphers**
Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

# **Hash algorithms**
MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160

# **Key Exchange Algorithms**
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

# Authentication
# --------------

# Secure Login directives.
UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

PermitUserEnvironment no
LoginGraceTime 30s
# Specifies  the  maximum  number  of authentication attempts permitted per connection.  Once the number of failures reaches half this value, additional failures are logged.
# Causes 'Too Many Authentication Failures' error when set to a low value and the user tries several keys.
MaxAuthTries 5
MaxSessions 10
MaxStartups 10:30:100

# Enable public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Never use host-based authentication. It can be exploited.
IgnoreRhosts yes
IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
HostbasedAuthentication no

# Enable PAM to enforce system wide rules
UsePAM no

# Disable password-based authentication, it can allow for potentially easier brute-force attacks.

# Network
# -------

# Disable TCP keep alive since it is spoofable. Use ClientAlive messages instead, they use the encrypted channel
TCPKeepAlive no

# Manage `ClientAlive..` signals via interval and maximum count. This will periodically check up to a `..CountMax` number of times within `..Interval` timeframe, and abort the connection once these fail.
ClientAliveInterval 600
ClientAliveCountMax 3

# Disable tunneling
PermitTunnel no

# Disable forwarding tcp connections.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowTcpForwarding no

# Disable agent forwarding, since local agent could be accessed through forwarded connection.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowAgentForwarding no

# Do not allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses.
